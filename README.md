# Bevy 2D Physics Test

Playing around with the Bevy game engine because I saw a comment on a YouTube short that said it was too hard to make a shrinking circle with a bouncing square in the middle.

Was feeling silly and wanted to learn about physics impulse so I made it so that the bounces play sounds and change the picture displayed in the square.

### Conclusion

Bevy is a seriously powerful game engine that streamlines the game dev process. The ECS model makes the development of systems like this very simple.
